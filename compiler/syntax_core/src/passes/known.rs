/// Here follows an abstract data structure to help us handle Erlang's
/// implicit matching that occurs when a variable is bound more than
/// once:
///
///     X = Expr1(),
///     X = Expr2()
///
/// What is implicit in Erlang, must be explicit in Core Erlang; that
/// is, repeated variables must be eliminated and explicit matching
/// must be added. For simplicity, examples that follow will be given
/// in Erlang and not in Core Erlang. Here is how the example can be
/// rewritten in Erlang to eliminate the repeated variable:
///
///     X = Expr1(),
///     X1 = Expr2(),
///     if
///         X1 =:= X -> X;
///         true -> error({badmatch,X1})
///     end
///
/// To implement the renaming, keeping a set of the variables that
/// have been bound so far is **almost** sufficient. When a variable
/// in the set is bound a again, it will be renamed and a `case` with
/// guard test will be added.
///
/// Here is another example:
///
///     (X=A) + (X=B)
///
/// Note that the operands for a binary operands are allowed to be
/// evaluated in any order. Therefore, variables bound on the left
/// hand side must not referenced on the right hand side, and vice
/// versa. If a variable is bound on both sides, it must be bound
/// to the same value.
///
/// Using the simple scheme of keeping track of known variables,
/// the example can be rewritten like this:
///
///     X = A,
///     X1 = B,
///     if
///         X1 =:= X -> ok;
///         true -> error({badmatch,X1})
///     end,
///     X + X1
///
/// However, this simple scheme of keeping all previously bound variables in
/// a set breaks down for this example:
///
///     (X=A) + fun() -> X = B end()
///
/// The rewritten code would be:
///
///     X = A,
///     Tmp = fun() ->
///               X1 = B,
///               if
///                   X1 =:= X -> ok;
///                   true -> error({badmatch,X1})
///               end
///           end(),
///     X + Tmp
///
/// That is wrong, because the binding of `X` created on the left hand
/// side of `+` must not be seen inside the fun. The correct rewrite
/// would be like this:
///
///     X = A,
///     Tmp = fun() ->
///               X1 = B
///           end(),
///     X + Tmp
///
/// To correctly rewrite fun bodies, we will need to keep addtional
/// information in a record so that we can remove `X` from the known
/// variables when rewriting the body of the fun.
