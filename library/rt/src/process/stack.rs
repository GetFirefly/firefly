/// in such a way that many small pushes near the end of the stack will not result in repeated reallocation.
/// Instead, the stack grows in size rapidly to keep reallocations to a minimum, at the expense of some wasted
/// memory.
///
/// The stack pointer starts at 0, and grows upwards - unlike traditional stack memory whose addresses normally
/// grow downwards. The stack pointer points to the next free slot on the stack, _not_ the most recently pushed
/// element.
///
/// # Features
///
/// * The stack can be manipulated granularly using [`push`]/[`pop`] or in bulk using [`alloca`]/[`dealloc`]
/// * The stack can be marked to indicate a point in the stack to which it should be reset when the mark is consumed
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The stack may only contain immediates and pointers to heap memory, it is not permitted to allocate on the stack
/// as if it was the heap.
///
/// # Layout
///
/// Call frames are laid out as follows, where the address on the left is relative to the frame pointer (fp):
///
///     N+1 | NONE           <- sp
///     N   | ARGN
///     .   |
///     2   | ARG0
///     1   | RETURN_ADDRESS
///     0   | RETURN_VALUE   <- fp
///
/// The first call frame in the call stack has a null return address, which is what signals that control
/// has reached the bottom of the call stack, and that the currently executing process should exit normally.
///
/// When a non-tail call is being made, the caller will have allocated a stack slot for the return value in its
/// call frame. The caller will ensure that immediately following that slot is room for the return address and all
/// of the callee arguments, and will set the frame pointer to the slot containing the return value, and the stack
/// pointer to the first slot following the last argument. At this point control will be transferred to the callee.
///
/// The callee, when returning to the caller, will move its return value into the first slot at the base of the frame,
/// get the return address from the second slot of the frame, and then restore the stack mark that was created by the caller,
/// restoring the stack and frame pointers to their prior positions.
///
/// Tail calls reuse the caller's frame, so arguments to the callee must be moved to their appropriate position on the
/// stack so that they are in the expected slots when control is transferred to the callee. This may require additional
/// stack slots in order to non-destructively shuffle values around.
///
/// Exception handlers also use stack marks to record the state of the stack which should be restored before transfering
/// control to the handler. The stack slot containing the continuation pointer for the handler is stored as part of the
/// mark, and is used to recover the pointer quickly when unwinding in the presence of an exception.
