//! This crate provides the abstractions necessary to construct
//! data structure agnostic compiler passes. It enables you to:
//!
//! * Construct a pass that receives an arbitrary input, and produces arbitrary output
//! * Construct a pass pipeline that chains passes, taking as input the first passes input type,
//! and outputing the last passes' output type. With this, you can represent lowering through
//! various intermediate representations using a single pass pipeline.
// This feature is only used for tests, and can be removed with minimal refactoring,
// but I'm in a rush and we're using nightly right now anyway

/// This trait represents anything that can be run as a pass.
///
/// Passes operate on an input value, and return either the same type, or a new type, depending on
/// the nature of the pass.
///
/// Implementations may represent a single pass, or an arbitrary number of passes that will be run
/// as a single unit.
///
/// Functions are valid implementations of `Pass` as long as their signature is `fn<I, O>(I) ->
/// Result<O, ()>`.
