/// This struct implements a semi-space generational heap, like that used in the
/// BEAM for Erlang processes.
///
/// A semi-space heap is characterized by the fact that it uses two heaps to store
/// two different classes of allocations - immature and mature - with all new allocations
/// going into the immature heap. The mature heap is used to hold allocations which have
/// survived at least one garbage collection, and are thus likely to survive subsequent
/// collections as well. As a result, the garbage collector can ignore objects on the mature
/// heap during minor collections, making those cycles much more efficient.
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// An invariant enforced by this semi-space heap is that there are never any pointers
/// from an older generation to a newer generation, i.e. from the mature heap to the immature
/// heap. Any referenced objects on the immature heap by objects being moved to the mature
/// heap must also be moved.
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// A semi-space heap goes through a specific set of phases:
///
/// 1. During this initial phase, only the immature heap has been allocated, while an empty
/// mature heap acts as a placeholder until the first GC cycle. All new allocations go to the
/// immature heap.
///
/// 2. The first minor GC cycle occurs. During this cycle, a new immature heap is allocated,
/// and live values reachable from the root set will be moved to the new heap. A high water mark
/// will be set, indicating where the heap was at when the cycle ended. The old immature heap is
/// freed.
///
/// 3. The second minor GC cycle occurs. During this cycle, a new immature heap is allocated, but
/// additionally, a mature heap is allocated with enough space to hold the old immature heap,
/// replacing the initial empty mature heap. Objects in the mature region of the immature heap (i.e.
/// allocations below the high-water mark) are moved to the mature heap. Objects above the high
/// water mark are moved to the new immature heap.
///
/// 4. During this phase, some number of minor GC cycles will occur, until the mature heap fills up
/// and needs to grow. When this happens, a major GC cycle occurs. During a major GC cycle, a new
/// mature heap is allocated and live matured objects from both heaps are swept into the new mature
/// heap. The old mature heap becomes the new immature heap, and the old immature heap is freed.
