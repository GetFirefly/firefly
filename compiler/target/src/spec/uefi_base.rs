// This defines a base target-configuration for native UEFI systems. The UEFI specification has
// quite detailed sections on the ABI of all the supported target architectures. In almost all
// cases it simply follows what Microsoft Windows does. Hence, whenever in doubt, see the MSDN
// documentation.
// UEFI uses COFF/PE32+ format for binaries. All binaries must be statically linked. No dynamic
// linker is supported. As native to COFF, binaries are position-dependent, but will be relocated
// by the loader if the pre-chosen memory location is already in use.
// UEFI forbids running code on anything but the boot-CPU. No interrupts are allowed other than
// the timer-interrupt. Device-drivers are required to use polling-based models. Furthermore, all
// code runs in the same environment, no process separation is supported.
