/// Unchecked shared pointer type
///
/// This type is essentially equivalent to a reference-counted
/// smart pointer, e.g. `Rc`/`Arc`, except that no reference count
/// is maintained. Instead the user of `BlockRef` must make sure
/// that the object pointed to is freed manually when no longer needed.
///
/// Guarantees that are expected to be upheld by users of `BlockRef`:
///
/// - The object pointed to by `BlockRef` is not moved or dropped
/// while a `BlockRef` points to it. This will result in use-after-free,
/// or undefined behavior.
/// - Additionally, you must not allow a mutable reference to be held
/// or created while a `BlockRef` pointing to the same object is in use,
/// unless special care is taken to ensure that only one or the other is
/// used to access the underlying object at any given time.
///
/// For example, if you create a `Block`, then create a `BlockRef` pointing
/// to that block, then subsequently obtain a mutable reference to the block
/// via the `BlockRef` or using standard means, then it must never be the
/// case that there are other active references pointing to the same object while
/// the mutable reference is in use.
///
/// NOTE: This type is used internally to make block management more ergonomic
/// while avoiding the use of raw pointers. It can be used in lieu of either
/// raw pointers or references, as it derefs to the `Block` it points to. Since
/// we have an extra flag bit in `Block` available, we could use it to track whether
/// more than one mutable reference has been created to the same block, and panic,
/// but currently that is not the case.
