/// This type implements the logic for performing a single garbage
/// collection on a process, given a set of roots from which live
/// values can be derived.
///
/// Each time a collection is required, an instance of this collector
/// should be created, with a reference to the process to collect, and
/// a set of roots from which live values will be traced. Once created,
/// the collector only runs when `collect` is called, and while it can
/// be safely called multiple times, the collector itself cannot be
/// held long-term, as it requires a mutable reference to the parent
/// process, and it is not necessary to keep alive, nor expensive to
/// recreate on-demand.
///
/// This collector can be described as having all of the following properties:
///
/// - It is a precise/tracing collector; the algorithm works by working from a set of "root" values
///   which are live somewhere, and which point into either the young or old heaps, or the process
///   stack
/// - It is generational; values that survive two minor collections are moved into the old
///   generation on the second collection, this is facilitated by the use of a high water mark in
///   the young heap which indicates where the last collection finished, everything under that point
///   which is still live is tenured
/// - It is a semi-space collector; minor collections consist of allocating a new young generation
///   and moving live values to the new heap, and if applicable, moving tenured values to the old
///   generation.
/// - It has some mark/sweep heritage; while the primary driver of liveness is the root set, when
///   all root set referenced values have been moved to the new heap, the new heap is traversed
///   word-by-word to locate any values which still point into the old young generation heap which
///   is about to be discarded. This is somewhat similar to a mark and sweep pass, except we are not
///   marking any values and then cleaning them up later, instead we move them immediately, almost
///   exactly the same way that we work with the root set.
///
/// The design is heavily inspired by that of the BEAM garbage collector,
/// with only minor changes. The current version today is not fully equal
/// to its cousin, as it doesn't handle the full set of capabilities the
/// BEAM supports, but as Lumen builds up its feature set, we will add those
/// missing features here correspondingly
///
/// NOTE: The portions of the collection process that are specific to the Process itself,
/// are handled by the `ProcessHeap::garbage_collect` function; this includes things like
/// cleaning up dead heap fragments, setting process flags for various conditions, calculating
/// statistics, and allocating/resizing heaps that the collector operates on. This keeps the
/// core collector general enough to be easily tested in isolation, and then plugged back in to
/// a `ProcessHeap` to test the higher-level integration.
